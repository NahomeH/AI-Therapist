# Sprint 3 Progress & Team Contributions

## Logistical Sprint Progress ðŸ’¼ :
- Based on advice from our industry mentor, we have refined and altered our project as follows:
  - Continue therapy angle, **narrow focus to lighter therapy topics** (e.g. stress, anxiety, depression)
    - Deprioritize agent capability to handle heavier topics (e.g. trauma, suicide)
  - **New/prioritized planned features**: user history / DB integration, scalability, agent quality / customizability
  - **Canceled/deprioritized features**: animated avatars, crisis management, model fine-tuning
- Max left the team to develop his own project separately

## Technical Sprint Progress ðŸš€ :
- Login / sign-up page with Supabase authentification
